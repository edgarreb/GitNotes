initializing: 

There are two ways in which we can create a new git repository. We can either manouver to the directory that we would like to initialize (in our local machine), or we can clone an existing git repository. To create a new git repo we must use the $ git init command. 

example (using Direc1 directory) 

cd /Desktop/Direc1
git init


At this point we have created a new git repo. When we commit and later push our updates to a remote repo on Github we may not want to push (or "keep track of") certian files. As an example when we compile our C source code we don't want to push our executable file (a.out). To stop tracking files we can create a .gitignore file in which we include the name of files or folders that we wouldn't like to ignore.
