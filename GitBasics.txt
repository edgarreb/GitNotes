initializing: 

There are two ways in which we can create a new git repository. We can either manouver to the directory that we would like to initialize (in our local machine), or we can clone an existing git repository. To create a new git repo we must use the $ git init command. 

example (using Direc1 directory) 

cd /Desktop/Direc1
git init


At this point we have created a new git repo. When we commit and later push our updates to a remote repo on Github we may not want to push (or "keep track of") certian files. As an example when we compile our C source code we don't want to push our executable file (a.out). To stop tracking files we can create a .gitignore file in which we include the name of files or folders that we wouldn't like to ignore. 

 


Staging:

We use the $ git add command to stage files. 

To remove a file that has already been staged we can use the $ git rm -- cached <file> command.



Branching:

To create a new branch we have to use the $ git branch <NameOfBranch> command. 

Once our new branch is created we can check what branch we are currently on by using the $ git branch -a command. This will show us all the branches in our repo as well as tell us the branch that we are currently on. 

To change from one branch to another we have to use the $ git checkout <NameOfBranch> command.
